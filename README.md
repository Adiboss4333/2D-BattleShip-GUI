## Welcome to the BattleShip Game
The Places in the Game are created on basis of the size of a Matrix or 2D Array i.e Rows and Columns. Therefore Total Places = Rows Ã— Columns
The Phases of the Game are explained below:-> 
1) In this Game, the User has to place their ships in the boxes provided by clicking them.
2)Then the Computer will start placing its ships.
3) After all the ships have been placed the user has to guess the Location of the Computers Ships by Clicking the Buttons.
   The Ships of the User are shown by a Ship Image, while the Ships of the Computer are hidden.
   If the User Blast a Computers Ship it will be shown with a bomb dropping image and green border,
   and if the Computer blasts the Users Ship it will be shown with a bomb dropping image and red border
4) If the user guesses correctly the Computers Ship will be blasted, and the same goes for the Computer.

Certain Sounds will be played on Blasting the Ships of the Computer or if the User's Ships get Blasted!
[NOTE] No Sound will be played if no ships are Blasted.

And this is how the Game Works, Enjoy the Game!!
